// For the cake:
// Preheat your oven to 350째F (180째C) and grease two 9-inch cake pans.
// In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
// In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs until they are light and frothy.
// Gradually add in the sugar, oil, and vanilla extract while continuing to beat the mixture until it is well combined.
// Stir in the grated carrots and chopped pecans (if using).
// Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until everything is well combined.
// Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans and smooth the surface with a spatula.
// Bake for approximately 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
// Remove the cake pans from the oven and let them cool completely before frosting.
// For the cream cheese frosting:
// In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until they are light and fluffy.
// Gradually add in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract while continuing to beat the mixture until it is smooth and creamy.
// Once the cakes have cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a generous layer of frosting on top.
// Place the second cake layer on top of the frosting and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.
// Optional: Garnish the top of the cake with additional chopped pecans or walnuts.
// Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to set the frosting before serving.
